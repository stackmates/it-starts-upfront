Have you ever been stuck wrestling with a problem that kept turning over and over in your head but you just couldn't make the breakthrough? Then you chat with someone that asks a simple question that makes you see things from a fresh perspective and light goes off and you are able to navigatge a new path through your problem.

From the moment we enter school we are given information to absorb into knowledge. **But when are we taught how to learn?** My breakthroughs never come from a teacher but from peers that defined the problem from their perspective and told a story for how they solved the problem. This is completely unscientific but my observation has been that good problem solvers do have strong intellects, but it is the way the look at problems and their methods for approaching the problem that really differentiates them.

Dreamineering seeks to address the meta and the matter of problem solving by helping people to share the thought processes and also connect with other's thought paths that resonate with them.


The dream is that this will help people and organizations find their purpose and enable new collaborations that will help advance our ability to solve problems for good and for profit.


## The theory

Evolving your thinking requires considering your problem from the the perspectives of the Philosopher, the Dreamer, the Engineer and the Realist.

Then creating two different type of thought loop to explore your options. Use a *provocation loop* to challenge your dogma and inspiration for generating ideas which you capture in an *affirmation loop* which are cut down to memorable haiku that enscapsulate the big picture whilst resonating with truth.


<blockquote class='t-important u-textCenter'>How do you stay on track?</blockquote>


**To resonate** is key. Cutting your thought processes down to haiku **will be difficult** but the reward is a deeper understanding of your problem as your haiku evolve.

Then you can use your haiku like **neural shortcuts** to move yourself into the right frame of mind or as guides through actions you need to take.

More importantly you will be able to communicate with greater clarity where you are coming from, where you are and where you intend to go which goes along way to gaining the support of others.

Whether you are pitching your startup, planning a family vacation or playing a round of golf using dreamineering will help you stay **connected** with your sense of purpose.
